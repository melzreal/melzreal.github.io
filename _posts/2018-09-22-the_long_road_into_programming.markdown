The first time I considered becoming a programmer was in 2013. 


Working for a startup - barely enough space, struggling to not toss the crumbles from the free biscuits on the head of the programmers sitting next to me - I had the chance to shadow the head programmer.


 I watched in awe as the 4 programmers spent an entire morning discussing a table feature, having a few coffees, not actually programming a thing then going off to lunch. The head programmer told me he started programming at 30 and was self taught.

I thought "well, guess 23 is not too late for a career change after all".

But wait (tape rewind sooounds) it's 2018!! And you still haven't "become a programmer"??  Giiiirl u laaazyy ?


I ADMIT I've watched a ton of netflix. Travelled a bit. Played final fantasy a bit. BUT I've also been finding a way in. And working full time.

It's different for everyone. This is not a "I've done it in a year" story. Here we go:


In 2013 that head programmer I mentioned introduced me to codeacademy after I told him how much I enjoyed looking at them work, how fascinating code looked. I went through codeacademy's html css and js tutorials while struggled immensely when the website failed - It was beyond me to be able to understand that sometimes its not your code but the platform you're using. 


That year, I kept working 2 jobs -Monday to Friday on a startup, Fridays and Saturdays I kept my university job as a cocktail bartender in a Tikki bar. By day a data admin, by weekends a tequilla drenched cocktail fire maker (don't mix, the idea of a drunk arse accident prone portuguese blowing fire doen't always end up well #wrayandnephews #tequillaisthedevil) 


2014 rolls in. By February I quit the bartending gig, bound on having some more time for life. The year went without seeing it and while changing jobs coding was put aside for a little. A friend told me about "Code first girls" when I mentioned wanting to learn programming - I signed up  for their free Ruby on Rails course at the beggining of 2015.


With no meaning to trash the course, it consisted of  one hour a week for a few weeks and I found it horribly confusing. That course was intended for people who had already done their intro course - but I qualified since I had completed the codeacademy intro courses. Issue was, I had no idea what the command line was doing, and with the instructor coding on a mac and me trying to follow on a windows well... it was impossible to follow along, and the time we had too short for 2 instructors to be able to assist everyone.


Also I find ruby on rails a horrible thing to do for beginners, and if you are one, would encourage you to start with a different language. I mean, why are there 40 files being generated with one command? What do these do?? "dont' worry about those" WHY SHOULD I NOT WORRY they are inside my app?? blurgh. 


Code first girls is great though despite my own confusion. It has some absolutely brilliant people and they organise events where you get to know other humans already in the industry. 


In one of those meetups with the staff of Bank of America Merryl Lynch my path took a turn; I met one of their programmers, a lady who told me about her journey (wish I could remember her name): She too had decided to change careers later and life and took a "conversion masters in computer science" to do it.


She explained in a conversion masters they assume no prior knowledge of the subject, so its just like a bachelors, except they help you specialise in a given subject. I already had a bachelors in politics that led me nowhere but to soul drenching data admin jobs while reading about interesting positions that all required science degrees.  


After some research I ended up enrolling part time in Queen Mary University for the Computing and Information Science msc. By then I had left the startup and started interviewing lawyers and writing editorials. It was early 2015 when I applied and got accepted for the programme in a September start.


Armed with fresh confidence and now able to put the details of attending this scientific course on my cv, I applied to my first tech position in News UK. They were advertising in the Milkround website, at the time also owned by News.

Its now 2018, 3 years since and I'm still part of the operations and engineering department at News. I've graduated the Msc in November 2017, but realised I had no credible programming portfolio after the masters - it was a broad introduction to all things tech, and it helped immensely understanding concepts like security certificates, networking and machine learning, but while the concepts are there, the practice is lagging as I could still not put all my ideas into code.


At the time the masters sounded like the perfect idea. After all, why pay 8k for a programming bootcamp if the same amount meant academic qualification that's is recognised everywhere? Looking back, it would have definitely saved me a lot of time to just go for the bootcamp, but the knowledge and experience of the masters were something I would never regret. Met some great people and I personally love University - so it's really up to you whether to go through that "experience" or if you prefer to get down to the point!


It's 2018. I've enrolled in flatiron's school online web developer programme after hearing about them in the code newbie podcast. These days code doesn't look like such a beast (in university the topic was Java, Ruby is sooo much nicer even to just look at). I've read many accounts of people coming in and out of coding. Even developers who would prefer to be product owners. And working in technology, I'm aware of the variety of jobs that are springing in the area - developer operations being the biggest focus for me at the moment.


Code doesn't feel like a completely unknown world to me. I know what all the files in my gem are doing! Its a relief.

So yes, still taking my time. Still watching netflix. But that much closer to becoming a full stack. Or an ops developer. Or hey, an unlimited amount of other things. You do you.


Just have fun on the way!
